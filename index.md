This workshop emphasizes hands-on learning of working with network data and visualization. Historians working out the complex documentary relationships between people and institutions can often find surprising, or previously unexplored, connections by using network analysis and its visual representations. This workshop will help participants familiarize themselves with basic network-analysis vocabulary as well as using Gephi for network analysis and visualization.

The workshop will address:

-   how networks are used in the humanities
-   how we can use networks in the classroom and in research
-   how to find, create, and use network data
-   how to use Gephi and alternative network analysis tools
